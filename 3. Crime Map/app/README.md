# Crime Map App

This folder contains an app-style rewrite of the crime map notebook, built with
modular Python files and a Streamlit entrypoint.

## Run locally

```powershell
cd "3. Crime Map/app"
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app reads data from the parent `3. Crime Map` directory (Boston and Cambridge
data and shapefiles).
